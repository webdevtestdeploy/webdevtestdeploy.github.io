            <p> As a member of the Enabling Technology workstream, I effectively coordinated the application enablement for
              outsourcing partners on Citrix and Virtual Desktops.
              By completing assessments of data handling methods and documenting processes, I ensured GDPR compliance for all
              external applications utilized by INGKA and its outsourcing partners.
            <p>To meet the high demands of all stakeholders, I approached my tasks in a diplomatic manner. The challenge of
              bridging the worlds of Business and IT in an environment where outsourcing partners cover daily business operation
              tasks required an empathetic approach as well as a thorough understanding of cultural influences on daily working
              routines.</p>

            <p>The assignment was to structure a scattered project repository with 160+ initiatives enabling efficient planning, prioritization and resource management.  </p>
            <p>
            Together with team members from Customer Fulfilment and Digital we created a structured process for how new initiatives are to be handled, maintained and closed.
            In my role as Business Development Analyst, I introduced these processes in workshop/teams session and 1:1 talks.
            Leading workshops, creating effective Powerpoint presentations, organizing initiatives in Microsoft Planner as our main tool, lead to an effectful structure and communication within the organisation.
            By creating weekly status reports based on parameters like RAG Level, progress and priority the initiatives being part of the plan. The plan inlcuded consideration of business strategies, KPIs and objectives to achieve long-term growth within Customer fulfilment.
            Reports I created based on data from Excel for utilization in monthly management meetings and recurring global team meetings to show the progress of the different projects.          </p>

            <p>MHS (Retail System) is a core application used in 360+ stores worldwide. Initially focused on Range and
              Supply, the system expanded over time to serve various demand areas in Retail stores.

              better systems
              available for this purpose.
              The project involved replacing and relocating sales-related functions from MHS to systems such as Return &

              Supply, MHS expanded over time to serve various demand areas in Retail stores.
              However, Sales Information is no longer considered essential within MHS as there are now better systems
              available for this purpose.
              The project involved replacing and relocating sales-related functions from MHS to systems such as Return &
              Recovery and Payment.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-2">Deliverables</h4>
          <p> NOTE: Rewrite deliverables. I analyzed and documented sales-related functions in the MHS system,
            identified suitable systems for these
            functions, and translated them into workflows in systems like Return & Recovery and Payments.
            The workflows were adapted to comply with rules and guidelines, serving as a basis for transformation. The
            work contributed to Change Management & Communication across <b>40+ countries</b> and <b>400+ stores
              worldwide</b>.
            As I joined the program late, my main focus was on analyzing the "Sales Adjustments" screen removal and new
            stock structure in MHS. </p>

            <p>The customer, a company providing strategic solutions in drug development, had the need of consolidating
              their office 365 platform by reducing licences and integrating a collaboration platform.
              Since there are a couple of collaboration tools available on the market it was required to compare the
              most common ones (Sharepoint Online, Box, Dropbox).
              Data should be consolidated and moved to one common platform.
              The analyse provided input on the way forward implementing a suitable collaboration tool usable for both
              customer communication and internal use. As a result the decision was made to use Sharepoint Online.</p>
            <p>
              Analyze and present a data integration and office 356 consolidation model to efficiently share documents
              between the customer internally and their respective customers.
              Analyse and explain Office 365 licensing models to consolidate the current Office 356 subscriptions to one
              subscription suitable for the company with 10 users.
              Prepare for consolidation of two office 356 tenants to one commonly used tenant.
