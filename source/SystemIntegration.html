            <p>The customer, a company providing strategic solutions in drug development, had the need of consolidating
              their office 365 platform by reducing licences and integrating a collaboration platform.
              Since there are a couple of collaboration tools available on the market it was required to compare the
              most common ones (Sharepoint Online, Box, Dropbox).
              Data should be consolidated and moved to one common platform.
              The analyse provided input on the way forward implementing a suitable collaboration tool usable for both
              customer communication and internal use. As a result the decision was made to use Sharepoint Online.</p>
